# NOTES

## Proposed changes

Reorder the steps to focus on key React functionality (like updating `state`) before dealing with API calls. Also incorporate styling earlier so what we look at looks better earlier since half-day sessions don't make it to step 10.

- 10-styling
  * app layout
  * conditional class names with `classnames` lib
