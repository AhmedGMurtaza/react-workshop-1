# Step 10 - Mark unread/read

## Setup

None

## Tasks

- Add a "Mark Unread" for each [`EmailListItem`](src/components/EmailListItem.js) that only shows when an item is selected (and read), making a `fetch` `PUT` when clicked
- Add "Mark Unread" & "Mark Read" buttons to [`EmailView`](src/components/EmailView.js) that will do the same
- When an `EmailListItem` is selected, it should also mark the email as read
- After making the `fetch` `PUT`, optimistically update the `emails` state
