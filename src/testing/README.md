# React & Redux Testing FUNdamentals Workshop

A step-by-step workshop to add tests for a React application using Redux, all while learning testing fundamentals. Best if accompanied with live facilitation. ðŸ™‚

## Exercises

All of the exercises assume existing knowledge of React, so you may want to follow the [React FUNdamentals workshop](../react/) prior to starting here.

Each step in the workshop builds on top of the previous one. If at any point you get stuck, you can find the answers in the source code of the current step. Any step can be used as a starting point to continue on to the remaining steps.
