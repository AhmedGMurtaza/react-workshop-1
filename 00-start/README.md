# Step 0 - Start

## TODO

If you haven't done so already, clone this [`react-workshop`](https://github.com/benmvp/react-workshop) repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/benmvp/react-workshop.git
```

Change to [`00-start`](https://github.com/benmvp/react-workshop/tree/master/00-start) directory:

```sh
cd react-workshop/00-start
```

Install [`serve`](https://github.com/tj/serve):

```sh
npm install serve
```

Run `serve` on port `8080` in [`src`](src/) directory:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/serve src --port 8080
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you should see an empty page.
